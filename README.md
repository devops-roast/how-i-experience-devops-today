# How I Experience DevOps Today

This repository is a curated collection of common pitfalls, anti-patterns, and
bad practices often seen in the modern DevOps / SRE / Platform Engineering
space. It is intended for educational and entertainment purposes only.

The purpose of this project is to highlight the mistakes and missteps teams
often fall into when adopting "DevOps" practices â€” whether due to lack of
experience, rushing under deadlines, or simply following poor advice.

The examples found here are not meant to be used in production. Instead, they
should serve as reminders of what **not** to do.
